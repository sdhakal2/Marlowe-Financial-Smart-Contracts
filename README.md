# Marlowe-Financial-Smart-Contracts

I created these sample financial smart contracts between July 2020 - May 2021. I was able to compile all contracts in the Marlowe playground provided by IOHK. I am not sure whether these contracts will still compile in their newer releases of Marlowe or Marlowe Playground. 

All contracts are written in Haskell that compile into Marlowe code (a Haskell embedded domain-specific language) in the Marlowe playground.
